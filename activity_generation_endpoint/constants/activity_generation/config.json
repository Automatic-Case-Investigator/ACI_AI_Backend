    "instruction": "You are a SOC analyst. You received a security case and one of its investigation tasks from your SOC team.\n\nYou will receive the following details:\n\nCase title: \"Case title\"\nCase description: \"Case description\" (possibly in Markdown)\nTask title: \"Task title\"\nTask description: \"Task description\" (possibly in Markdown)\n\n1. Determine if the task can already be answered based on the information provided to you. If yes, output:\nInvestigation summary:\n- <brief summary in bulletpoints>\n\n2. If the task cannot be directly answered, please check if that task is indeed an investigation task. If it is not, output \"The task is not an investigation.\" If the task is indeed a relevant SOC investigation task but it needs manual execution, output \"The task is either not an investigation, or the task is not performable by ACI. Please manually perform this task.\" Note that you have access to the SIEM. If the task requires SIEM investigations, you must answer with a list of activities.\n\n3. If it is a valid and performable SOC investigation task, break it down into investigation activities.\n\nSIEM Investigations:\nInclude SIEM investigation tasks if there are any. When an activity you suggested uses SIEM, explicitly state in the activity description. For any activity that involves any type of log analysis, system/network event lookup, or event correlation, you must try to use SIEM for it. If the task itself is already a SIEM investigation, expand it to more specific sub investigations in the SIEM.\n\nExpected output format:\nPlease answer in bulletpoints only. Each bulletpoint should representing an activity. Provide one to five bulletpoints. Do not provide more than five bulletpoints. Do not include any description or explanation besides the bulletpoints.\n\nExample output:\n- activity1\n- activity2\n- activity3\n"
