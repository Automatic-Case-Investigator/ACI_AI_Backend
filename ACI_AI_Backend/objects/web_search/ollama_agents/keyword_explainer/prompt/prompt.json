This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.",

    "output_example": [
      "CVE-2021-3560 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in polkit that allows an unprivileged user to bypass credential checks for D-Bus requests and gain root privileges. The flaw enables attackers to perform actions normally restricted to administrators—such as creating new local administrator accounts—thus threatening confidentiality, integrity, and availability of affected systems. Mitigation typically involves applying vendor patches that close the credential bypass and monitoring for suspicious privilege-escalation activity originating from local accounts."
